# Project pitch "VISUALIZING KTH CO2 EMISSIONS FROM FLYING"

Researchers fly a lot. This includes researchers at KTH, but KTH has adopted ambitious goals to reduce our CO2 emissions from travel between 2020-2030. 
(While travel has been temporarily suppressed by Covid restrictions, we assume that they will bounce back once restrictions are eased.) 
The first step towards reducing CO2 emissions is to better understand our travel habits and our current emissions. But what would be the best way to visualize KTH travel data so as to help people (individual researchers as well as heads of departments and the KTH president) understand current emissions in relation to the future CO2 reduction goals that KTH has committed to?
